*** NYCDSA/7Park Capstone Project ***
- Goal of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI)
- Notebooks and scripts
  - income inequality: Clean up initial raw income inequality data
  - income_and_households: Clean up initial raw income and households data
  - job_openings: Clean up initial raw job openings data
  - Unemployment_data_collection: Clean up initial raw unemployment  data
  - vacancy: Clean up initial raw vacancy data
  - Final EDA: EDA of each feature
  - features: Aggregates all the features and clean them up further to produce final clean csv for each feature
  - us_state_abbrev: py script to convert between state abbreviations and state names
  - data_for_models: py script that produces dataframes for model testing using clean feature csv files
  - models: Contains machine learning models to predict ZORI
  - Slope Models: Contains machine learnings models that involves slopes of ZORI and features over time
  - Logistical Models: Contains logistical model to predict which zipcode saw a COVID boom or bust in rental prices
